ableism-eradicator is a clumsy little autohotkey script i made to help me eradicate the more pervasive ableist words from my vocabulary 

if the script is running and you type the words "stupid," "dumb," "crazy," "insane," or "idiot," the script will provide a randomized list of other options and replace the slur with the alternative you select 

if you want the alternatives without typing the slur, use the shortcut "!c" for crazy/insane, "!s" for stupid/dumb, or "!i" for idiot 

this script was adapted froma script by Jack Dunning (https://jacksautohotkeyblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/replacing-overused-words-with-pop-up-synonym-menus-part-7-beginning-hotstrings/)
with alternative words taken in part from anagnori (https://anagnori.tumblr.com/post/71020734063/alternatives-to-saying-stupid)

you can find instructions for running .ahk scripts with autohotkey here: https://www.autohotkey.com/
or you can run the compliled .exe on its own.
